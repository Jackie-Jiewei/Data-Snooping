White Reality Check for Solving Data Snooping Problem
Technical trading rules have been used in financial markets for more than a century. Numerous studies have been performed to determine whether such rules can be employed to provide superior investing performance. In perhaps the most comprehensive recent study of technical trading rules using 90 years of daily stock prices, Brock, Lakonishok, and LeBaron (1991) find that 26 technical trading rules applied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average significantly outperform a benchmark of holding cash. Their findings are especially strong because every one of the trading rules they consider is capable of beating the benchmark. When taken at face value, these results indicate either that the stock market is not efficient even in the weak form—a conclusion which, if found to be robust, will go against most researchers’ prior beliefs—or that risk premia display considerable variation even over very short periods of time (i.e., at the daily interval).
